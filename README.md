ETF Volatility Arbitrage Trading Team in Trading @ GT

## Overview
This program compares the implied volatility of an ETF with the implied volatility of its components to find arbitrage opportunities.
Currently our system periodically generates volatility surfaces to find descrepancies in the theoretical and empirical volatilities for an ETF.
